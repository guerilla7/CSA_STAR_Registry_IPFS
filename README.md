### What is this?

Its a simple Proof of Concept (PoC) on how the Cloud Security Alliance and other similar organizations can utilize a decentralized storage file system for publishing audit/self-attestation reports of its members.

I plan to grab all the names of the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) that registered to CSA's STAR Registry and host it here on this repo.  View the current STAR Registry here: [CSA STAR](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/#_registry)


### Why?

So I can use it as data source for my test IPFS gateway server running in the cloud.

### What is IPFS?

IPFS stands for InterPlanetary File Transfer Protocol.  A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Go learn it now here: [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

### So where's the list?

View the first five entries I added on my IPFS server using the following URL:

https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/"file-hash"

Replace "file-hash" with the following:

### What's next after this?

I want to build a decentralized on-line library powered by IPFS and some magical unicorn dusts that will empower all public schools around the world.  If you have unicorns, please help me out.
